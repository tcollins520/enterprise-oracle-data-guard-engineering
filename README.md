# Oracle Database 19c Data Guard — Production-Grade DR Exercise

Production-grade Oracle Database 19c Data Guard engineering exercise implemented on AWS,
covering physical standby construction, redo transport, controlled role transitions,
disaster failover, standby recovery, reinstate/rebuild, and final DR validation.

The project follows a controlled engineering lifecycle. The goal is not simply to
create a standby database, but to demonstrate the complete disaster-recovery lifecycle:
build, replicate, validate, perform controlled role transitions, fail over, recover,
reinstate, switch back, and validate again.

> **A standby database that has never been tested does not prove
> disaster-recovery readiness.**

## Project Goal

Demonstrate that an Oracle Database 19c environment can:

1.  Run as a primary database.
2.  Continuously transport redo to a physical standby.
3.  Apply redo and maintain synchronization.
4.  Detect and troubleshoot replication issues.
5.  Survive a controlled primary failure through Data Guard failover.
6.  Promote the standby to the new primary.
7.  Recover and reinstate/rebuild the former primary.
8.  Perform a planned switchover.
9.  Return to a healthy Data Guard configuration.

This project is designed as a **production-grade DR exercise executed in a controlled
AWS environment**.

# Phase 0 — AWS Infrastructure

Before beginning the Oracle implementation implementation, the AWS foundation is
provisioned with Terraform.

## Current AWS Environment
```
Region: `us-east-1`

The database servers are intentionally deployed across separate
Availability Zones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 1 — Oracle Platform Build & Baseline

## Objective

Build and validate the Oracle 19c platform on both database servers before configuring Data Guard.

## Baseline

Validate:

- Oracle software installation
- Oracle environment variables
- Oracle inventory and Oracle Home
- Database instance status
- CDB/PDB status
- Listener and registered services
- Filesystems and available storage
- CPU, memory, swap, and system load
- Tablespace capacity
- Session and process utilization

A reusable Oracle health-check script performs top-to-bottom OS and Oracle checks, including database role and ARCHIVELOG status, listener/services, tablespaces, and session/process utilization. 

## Validation

```bash
./oracle_health_check.sh
```

The baseline should be captured before patching and again after patching to provide documented pre-change and post-change evidence.

---

# Phase 2 — RMAN Backup & Recovery Configuration

## Objective

Establish a working RMAN backup and recovery foundation before Data Guard role-transition testing.

## Backup Strategy

The environment will use RMAN backups for:

- Database backups
- Archived redo logs
- Current control file
- Control file autobackup
- Backup metadata maintenance
- Restore validation

The project includes a Level 0 full-backup script and a Level 1 incremental-backup script. The Level 0 script backs up the database, archived redo logs, and current control file using compressed backupsets. fileciteturn6file0L6-L16 The Level 1 script provides the daily incremental equivalent and also includes archived redo logs and the current control file. 

## Recovery Validation

```text
[ ] RMAN control file autobackup enabled
[ ] Existing backups cross-checked
[ ] Expired backup metadata removed
[ ] Database backup completed
[ ] Archived redo logs backed up
[ ] Current control file backed up
[ ] Backup summary reviewed
[ ] RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE completed successfully
```

The RMAN validation workflow performs `RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE` after the backup and records timestamped backup and validation logs. 

## Operational Backup Evidence

Document:

- Backup location
- Backup schedule
- Backup types
- Backup logs
- Validation results
- Retention requirements
- Recovery objectives

> Backup retention, storage, encryption, monitoring, and recovery objectives will be finalized as part of the production-grade design rather than assumed from the scripts alone.

---

# Phase 3 — Oracle 19c Release Update Patching

## Objective

Patch DB01 and DB02 to the same supported Oracle Database 19c Release Update level before establishing the final Data Guard configuration.

## Patch Strategy

The patching procedure will follow the established Oracle 19c database patching workflow used for DB01 and will be applied consistently to both database servers.

```text
Pre-Patch Baseline
        ↓
RMAN / Recovery Verification
        ↓
Oracle Home & Database Validation
        ↓
July 2026 RU Installation
        ↓
Post-Patch SQL / Database Actions
        ↓
Listener / Service Validation
        ↓
Database Version Validation
        ↓
Post-Patch Health Check
```

## Validation

```text
[ ] DB01 pre-patch health captured
[ ] DB02 pre-patch health captured
[ ] RMAN recovery backup verified
[ ] DB01 patched
[ ] DB02 patched
[ ] Database patch level verified on both servers
[ ] Oracle Home versions consistent
[ ] Listener/services healthy
[ ] Database opens successfully
[ ] Post-patch health checks pass
[ ] Final patch evidence captured
```

Both databases must be on compatible Oracle software and patch levels before proceeding to Data Guard configuration.

---

# Phase 4 — Data Guard Architecture & DR Design

## Objective

Understand the architecture and purpose of Oracle Data Guard before
configuring the environment.

## Concepts

-   Primary database
-   Physical standby database
-   Redo transport
-   Redo apply
-   Data Guard roles
-   Switchover
-   Failover
-   Disaster recovery
-   RPO
-   RTO

## Architecture Implementation

``` text
                 AWS us-east-1
                       │
          ┌────────────┴────────────┐
          │                         │
     us-east-1a                us-east-1b
          │                         │
      ┌───────┐                 ┌───────┐
      │ DB01  │ ─── Redo ─────> │ DB02  │
      │PRIMARY│                 │STANDBY│
      └───────┘                 └───────┘
```

DB01 will become the primary database. DB02 will become the physical
standby.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 5 — Primary Database Preparation

## Objective

Prepare DB01 to operate as the Data Guard primary.

## Configuration

-   ARCHIVELOG mode
-   FORCE LOGGING
-   Standby redo logs
-   Data Guard initialization parameters
-   Archive destinations
-   FAL configuration
-   Automatic standby file management

## Validation

``` sql
SELECT name,
       log_mode,
       force_logging
FROM v$database;
```

Expected:

``` text
LOG_MODE       ARCHIVELOG
FORCE_LOGGING  YES
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 6 — Oracle Net & Data Guard Connectivity

## Objective

Use the Q&A material as a troubleshooting checkpoint before building the
standby.

## Troubleshooting Focus

-   Oracle Net connectivity
-   Listener configuration
-   TNS resolution
-   SYSDBA connectivity
-   ARCHIVELOG configuration
-   FORCE LOGGING
-   Standby redo logs
-   Data Guard parameters
-   RMAN connectivity
-   File paths
-   Permissions
-   Oracle environment variables

## Connectivity Checks

``` bash
tnsping ORCLPRI
tnsping ORCLSTBY
```

Then:

``` bash
sqlplus sys/<password>@ORCLPRI as sysdba
```

Passwords and secrets are never stored in this repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 7 — Physical Standby Construction

## Objective

Build DB02 as a physical standby using the appropriate RMAN seeding method for the
size and operational requirements of the database.

## Current Project — Active Database Duplication

The current project uses RMAN Active Database Duplication because the database is
small enough for direct network-based duplication and the environment is designed to
demonstrate the complete Data Guard build.

```text
DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE
FOR STANDBY
FROM ACTIVE DATABASE
DORECOVER
```

This method copies the primary database over the network while the primary remains
available. It is practical for small-to-moderate databases when network throughput,
backup infrastructure, and primary workload permit it.

## Large Database Strategy — Backup-Based Standby Construction

For a very large production database, such as a **4 TB database**, the preferred
approach is to use **RMAN backup-based duplication** and pre-stage/copy the backup
files to the standby or shared backup storage. This avoids making the initial 4 TB
seed a live network copy from the primary and gives the DBA more control over
throughput, restartability, backup retention, and primary workload.

### Large Database Workflow

```text
PRIMARY
   │
   ├── RMAN Level 0 / full backup
   ├── RMAN archived redo backups
   ├── Standby control file / control file backup
   │
   ▼
BACKUP STORAGE
   │
   ├── Copy / stage backup pieces
   │
   ▼
STANDBY
   │
   ├── Catalog backup pieces
   ├── RMAN restore / duplicate
   ├── Apply archived redo
   └── Start managed recovery
```

### 4 TB Standby Build Steps

**1. Prepare standby storage**

Provision enough storage for the 4 TB database plus control files, online/standby
redo logs, FRA, temporary restore space, and operational headroom.

**2. Generate a seed backup on the primary**

Use RMAN parallelism and multisection backups where appropriate for the storage and
CPU available:

```rman
RUN {
  ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
  ALLOCATE CHANNEL c2 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
  ALLOCATE CHANNEL c3 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
  ALLOCATE CHANNEL c4 DEVICE TYPE DISK;

  BACKUP AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET
    DATABASE
    SECTION SIZE 16G
    FORMAT '/backup/dg_seed/%U';

  BACKUP AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET
    ARCHIVELOG ALL
    FORMAT '/backup/dg_seed/%U';

  BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE FOR STANDBY
    FORMAT '/backup/dg_seed/standby_control_%U.ctl';

  RELEASE CHANNEL c1;
  RELEASE CHANNEL c2;
  RELEASE CHANNEL c3;
  RELEASE CHANNEL c4;
}
```

Choose `SECTION SIZE` and channel count based on actual I/O and storage capacity;
do not assume that four channels or 16 GB sections are optimal for every system.

**3. Validate the backup before moving it**

Run RMAN validation and confirm the backup pieces are usable:

```rman
CROSSCHECK BACKUP;
RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
```

**4. Copy/stage the backup files**

Move the backup pieces to the standby or an accessible backup repository. For large
files, use a restartable transfer method appropriate for the environment (for example,
parallel file transfer, enterprise backup infrastructure, or object storage).

Do not require a single uninterrupted 4 TB network stream from DB01 to DB02.

**5. Prepare the standby Oracle environment**

Configure the Oracle Home, database directories, permissions, password file, Oracle
Net connectivity, standby redo logs, and standby initialization parameters.

**6. Catalog the copied backups on the standby**

For backup pieces staged locally on DB02:

```rman
CATALOG START WITH '/backup/dg_seed/' NOPROMPT;
```

Verify that RMAN sees the expected backup sets.

**7. Create the physical standby from the backup location**

Use backup-based RMAN duplication rather than `FROM ACTIVE DATABASE`:

```rman
DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE
FOR STANDBY
BACKUP LOCATION '/backup/dg_seed'
DORECOVER
SPFILE
SET db_unique_name='ORCLCDG_STB'
SET fal_server='ORCLCDG'
NOFILENAMECHECK;
```

Adjust file-name conversion or `SET NEWNAME`/`DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT` strategy to the
actual storage layout. `NOFILENAMECHECK` is appropriate only when the source and
auxiliary databases use separate hosts and the resulting file placement is known to
be safe.

**8. Catch up the standby with archived redo**

If the primary continued generating redo while the backup was being transferred,
ship the subsequent archived redo to the standby and apply it. For a long-running
seed, an additional incremental roll-forward can be used to reduce the final redo
catch-up window.

**9. Start managed recovery**

```sql
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE
DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;
```

**10. Validate synchronization**

Confirm the standby role, MRP/RFS processes, archive destination status, archive gap,
transport lag, apply lag, and primary/standby sequence progression.

```sql
SELECT name,
       db_unique_name,
       database_role,
       open_mode
FROM v$database;

SELECT process,
       status,
       thread#,
       sequence#
FROM v$managed_standby
ORDER BY process;

SELECT *
FROM v$archive_gap;

SELECT name, value, unit
FROM v$dataguard_stats
WHERE name IN ('transport lag', 'apply lag', 'apply finish time');
```

## Large Database Operational Notes

- Keep the standby storage and backup repository sized for the full database plus redo
  growth and operational headroom.
- Use incremental backups when the standby falls significantly behind and re-copying
  the entire 4 TB database is not operationally acceptable.
- Pre-stage backup files before the final cutover window whenever possible.
- Measure backup/transfer/restore throughput rather than estimating the recovery window
  from database size alone.
- Protect backup files with the same access controls and encryption requirements used
  for production backups.
- Keep the primary and standby on compatible Oracle software and patch levels.

## Start Redo Apply

On DB02:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE
DISCONNECT FROM SESSION;
```

## Validation

```sql
SELECT name,
       db_unique_name,
       database_role,
       open_mode
FROM v$database;
```

Expected on DB02:

```text
DATABASE_ROLE
-------------
PHYSICAL STANDBY
```

---

# Phase 8 — Redo Transport & Apply Validation

## Objective

Prove that redo generated on DB01 is successfully transported to DB02 and applied by the physical standby.

## Validation

```text
[ ] Primary generates redo
[ ] Standby receives redo
[ ] Standby redo logs functioning
[ ] Managed recovery active
[ ] Redo apply progressing
[ ] Archive gap is empty
[ ] Transport errors reviewed
[ ] Apply lag reviewed
[ ] Primary/standby sequence numbers compared
```

Key checks include:

```sql
SELECT dest_id,
       status,
       target,
       destination,
       error
FROM v$archive_dest
WHERE target = 'STANDBY';
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM v$archive_gap;
```

```sql
SELECT process,
       status,
       thread#,
       sequence#
FROM v$managed_standby;
```

---

# Phase 9 — Client Connectivity & Service Validation

## Objective

Configure and validate client connectivity in a Data Guard environment.

## Topics

-   Oracle Net Services
-   TNS aliases
-   Database services
-   Primary/standby connectivity
-   Role-aware client connections
-   Connection testing

Example aliases:

``` text
ORCLPRI
ORCLSTBY
```

Connectivity:

``` bash
tnsping ORCLPRI
tnsping ORCLSTBY
```

The final project will document how client connectivity behaves before
and after role transitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 10 — Planned Switchover & Snapshot Standby

## Objective

Practice planned role transitions and understand Snapshot Standby behavior.

### Planned Switchover

```text
Before:

DB01 PRIMARY
     │
     │ Redo
     ▼
DB02 STANDBY

After:

DB01 STANDBY
     ▲
     │ Redo
     │
DB02 PRIMARY
```

Before the switchover:

```text
[ ] Redo transport healthy
[ ] Redo apply healthy
[ ] No archive gap
[ ] Standby synchronized
[ ] Client connectivity validated
[ ] Role-transition procedure reviewed
```

After the switchover:

```text
[ ] Former standby is PRIMARY
[ ] Former primary is STANDBY
[ ] Redo transport reversed
[ ] Redo apply working
[ ] Client connections validated
```

Snapshot Standby testing, if supported by the environment, will be documented
separately from the destructive failover exercise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 11 — Disaster Failover & Active Data Guard

## Objective

Perform the project's primary disaster-recovery test.

### Replication Test

```sql
CREATE TABLE DG_FAILOVER_TEST (
    id         NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    note       VARCHAR2(200)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO DG_FAILOVER_TEST
VALUES (
    1,
    SYSTIMESTAMP,
    'Created on original primary'
);

COMMIT;
```

Generate redo:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
```

Verify the transaction on the standby before the failure simulation.

### Primary Failure Simulation

For the controlled DR exercise:

```sql
SHUTDOWN ABORT;
```

### Failover

Promote the synchronized physical standby to the new primary using the approved
role-transition procedure for the environment.

### Verify New Primary

```sql
SELECT name,
       db_unique_name,
       database_role,
       open_mode
FROM v$database;
```

Expected:

```text
DATABASE_ROLE
-------------
PRIMARY
```

Verify the test data:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM DG_FAILOVER_TEST;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 12 — Reinstate / Rebuild Former Primary

## Objective

Recover the former primary and return the environment to a healthy Data Guard
configuration.

The former primary should not simply be restarted and returned to service after
failover. Where supported by the final Broker configuration and database state, use
reinstate. Otherwise rebuild the former primary as a physical standby using RMAN.

```text
FAILOVER
   ↓
NEW PRIMARY
   ↓
REINSTATE OR REBUILD FORMER PRIMARY
   ↓
REDO APPLY
   ↓
SYNCHRONIZED STANDBY
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 13 — Data Guard Broker & DR Operations

## Objective

Use Data Guard Broker to centrally manage and validate the Data Guard environment
**after the manual switchover and failover exercises have been completed**.

## Enable Broker

On both databases:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET DG_BROKER_START=TRUE SCOPE=BOTH;
```

## Create Broker Configuration

Use the final role-aware service names and connect identifiers established during
client/service validation. Example structure:

```text
CREATE CONFIGURATION ORCL_DG AS
PRIMARY DATABASE IS <PRIMARY_DB_UNIQUE_NAME>
CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS <PRIMARY_CONNECT_IDENTIFIER>;
```

Add the standby:

```text
ADD DATABASE <STANDBY_DB_UNIQUE_NAME> AS
CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS <STANDBY_CONNECT_IDENTIFIER>
MAINTAINED AS PHYSICAL;
```

Enable:

```text
ENABLE CONFIGURATION;
```

## Broker Validation

```text
SHOW CONFIGURATION;

VALIDATE DATABASE <PRIMARY_DB_UNIQUE_NAME>;

VALIDATE DATABASE <STANDBY_DB_UNIQUE_NAME>;

VALIDATE NETWORK CONFIGURATION FOR ALL;
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final DR Exercise

        ↓
12. PLANNED SWITCHOVER
        ↓
13. DATA GUARD BROKER
        ↓
14. FINAL VALIDATION
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 13 — Reinstate / Rebuild Former Primary

The former primary should not simply be restarted and returned to
service after failover.

Where possible:

``` text
REINSTATE DATABASE ORCLPRI;
```

Then:

``` text
SHOW CONFIGURATION;

VALIDATE DATABASE ORCLPRI;
```

If reinstate is not possible, rebuild the former primary as a physical
standby using RMAN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 14 — Final DR Validation & Recovery Evidence

## Final Switchover

Once the original primary has been restored as a synchronized standby:

``` text
SWITCHOVER TO ORCLPRI;
```

Final architecture:

``` text
DB01
PRIMARY
   │
   │ Redo Transport
   ▼
DB02
PHYSICAL STANDBY
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# RPO / RTO Evidence

The final DR exercise will record measurable recovery information.

## RPO

Record:

-   Last generated redo sequence
-   Last received redo sequence
-   Last applied redo sequence
-   Archive gap status
-   Replication lag

## RTO

Measure:

``` text
Primary Failure
      ↓
Failure Detection
      ↓
Failover
      ↓
New Primary Available
      ↓
Validation Complete
```

The final project should record actual measured values rather than
theoretical targets.

# Key Operational Principle

**Data Guard is more than creating a standby database.**

A production-ready DR strategy requires:

``` text
PROVISION
  ↓
BASELINE
  ↓
BACK UP
  ↓
PATCH
  ↓
CONFIGURE
  ↓
REPLICATE
  ↓
VALIDATE
  ↓
TEST
  ↓
FAIL
  ↓
FAILOVER
  ↓
RECOVER
  ↓
REINSTATE
  ↓
SWITCHOVER
  ↓
VALIDATE AGAIN
```

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the DBA understands
not only **how to configure Data Guard**, but also **how to operate it
when something goes wrong**.
